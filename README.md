# ML_learning_projects
This repo contains all the ML projects that i created during my learning process.

Here are the ML algorithms that i worked on:
1. Regression Models( Linear Regresssion, Logistic Regression)
2. Clustering(k-means)
3. K Nearest Neighbour(KNN)
4. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Native Bayes

Worked on various datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
eg: Titanic Survival, Iris flower species, etc.

Also, created some own dataset to run unsupervised models like K-means clustering.
eg: ![image](https://github.com/zews78/ML_learning_projects/assets/56071706/91b00a9c-b04a-4ac8-8a0a-cdb8acb11ec4)
